                <p>Our wedding will be at an outdoor venue on a warm spring day, so do not feel the need to bring our your ballgown and black tux!  Feel free to dress comfortably in your Easter best!  Sundresses, khakis, linen, bright or pastel colors.  Our wedding is coincidentally the same day as the Kentucky Derby which perfectly encapsulates the dress code!  Also, ladies, the ceremony will be on grass so make appropriate shoe choices.  Wedges, espadrilles, and flats are welcome. We ask for no white in consideration of the bride.</p>
